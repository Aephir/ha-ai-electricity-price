# Test integration for calculating actual electricity prices

Work in progress, will likely not work as expected.

### Requirements
- Nordpool sensor in Home Assistant
- API Token and metering point for Eloverblik

### Known limitations
- Can't predict tomorrow's prices if tariffs are different than today (changing "seasons")
